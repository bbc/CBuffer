* CBuffer

** Overview

A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses 
a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end. This structure 
lends itself easily to buffering data streams. This library impliments such a 
buffer.

** Installation

: gem install cbuffer

** Usage

: require 'cbuffer'
:
: a = CBuffer.new 5 => <CBuffer @size=5> 
: a.put 1 => false 
: a.put 2 => false 
: a.put "Duncan" => false 
: a.put 999 => false 
: a.get => 1 
: a.get => 2 
: a.get => "Duncan" 
: a.put "xxx" => false 
: a.get => 999
