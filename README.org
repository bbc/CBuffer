* CBuffer

** Overview

A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses 
a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end. This structure 
ends itself easily to buffering data streams. This library impliments such a 
buffer.

** Installation

: gem install cbuffer

** Usage

: require 'cbuffer'
:
: # easy url resolving 
: Linkr.resolve("http://bbc.in/pdTHqe") => http://www.bbc.co.uk
:
: # if you need more info
: link = Linkr.new("http://bbc.in/pdTHqe", {
:   redirect_limit => 10 # default 5
: })
