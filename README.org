* CBuffer

** Overview

A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses 
a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end. This structure 
ends itself easily to buffering data streams. This library impliments such a 
buffer.

** Installation

: gem install cbuffer

** Usage

: require 'cbuffer'
:
: cb = CBuffer.new(3)
: cb.put {:item=>"one"}
: cb.put {:item=>"two"}
: cb.put {:item=>"three"}
: cb.get => {:item=>"one"}
: cb.get => {:item=>"two"}
: cb.put {:item=>"four"}
: cb.get => {:item=>"three"}

** TODO

- fetch items by index
- view onto items

** Contributing
